# GrundosCafeMobileCSS
Enhanced mobile CSS for grundos.cafe. Main page is located on /~HiImAGrub/.

The main attraction is `mobilecss.css`. 

* AIO sidebar and left nav are collapsible
  * for people who only want the right one to be collapsible, use `rightcollapsibleonly.css`.
* Use landscape mode to fit larger games on the entire screen

There is also an optional enhancement SDB css `NoDescriptionCol.css`, which optimizes horizontal space by removing item descriptions.
